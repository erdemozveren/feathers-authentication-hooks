# feathers-sequelize-authentication-hooks
This is forked from [feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-authentication-hooks](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-authentication-hooks) and modified for sequelize.If you don't know how to use this,You can check doc. at original repo.

## What is diffrent
I just change the part of code that get fields from user model and default 'idField' value set to 'id' therefore everything else is just same as original repo.

#### Ps
I did not try full security check but seems work for now.
